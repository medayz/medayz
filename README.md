### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

**Here's some stuff about me:**

* I'm a Frontend Developer, mainly using **React**. I'm interested in Functional Programming and technologies from the React ecosystem.

* I spent the last four years learning and building with Javascript and React, and about a couple of years that passed already using these technologies in a professional environment.
  - I started at school by building a dating app and a torrent streaming platform.
  - Then, I worked on an identity verification SAAS MVP at my internship.
  - I've had some freelance experience working on a SAAS and an e-commerce website later, for half a year.
  - Finally, I spent more than a year now working full-time, building and maintaining a large-scale e-commerce website.

* Besides coding :keyboard: I love sunny days :sunny: music :guitar: traveling :earth_africa: soccer :soccer: and design :computer_mouse:

* I like having a cup of coffee :coffee: in the morning and some morroccan tea :morocco: :tea: in the afternoon.
