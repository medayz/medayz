### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

**Here's some stuff about me:**

* I'm a Frontend Developer, currently focusing on **React** and related technologies. I'm also interested in Functional Programming and I love writing functional style code.

* I'm a student at [1337](https://1337.ma) where I learned about algorithms and web development. 1337 is part of the international [42 network] (https://www.42.fr/42-network). The 42 pedagogy is based on learning by building projects and peer-review. That helped me gain experience in building modern web applications, defending my code, and working in a team.

* I spent the last year learning about **JavaScript**, **React** and building school projects with these technologies, I also had a **six-month internship in Frontend Engineering** where I used primarily **React** to build web applications.

* Besides coding :keyboard:, I love sunny days :sunny:, music :guitar:, traveling :earth_africa:, soccer :soccer:, and design :computer_mouse:

* I love equally drinking both, Coffee :coffee: and The Moroccan :morocco: Tea :tea:	

Currently looking for a full-time Frontend Engineer job :computer:
