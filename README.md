### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

**Here's some stuff about me:**

  - I started at school by building a dating app and a torrent streaming platform.
  - At my internship, I built the UI of an identity verification SAAS MVP .
  - I've been coding websites for about 3 years exclusively with JS/TS and React. Most of my professional experience was in e-commerce and SAAS solutions.
